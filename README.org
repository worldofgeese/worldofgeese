**** I'm [[https://t.me/taoscienceskyrocket][Tao]], your friendly DevRel at garden.io.

The Web is an Indra's Net of self-sovereign machines. My contributions to its pantheon are [[https://traefik.hansen.agency][mother]], Loving Kypris and Endless Summer. In the past I directed little [[https://tube.hansen.agency][films]] of joy.

In another life I was Sovereign Bleak, a false prophet of a transhumanist movement making how-to guides for surgically implanting finger-magnets.
