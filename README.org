**** I'm [[https://t.me/taoscienceskyrocket][Tao]], your friendly Kubernetes, Dev[Sec]Ops Architect 👷

I believe in dogfooding your own code and selfhost everything I can get away with, from Kubernetes clusters to Docker Swarms. In my spare time I hack on my homeserver [[https://traefik.hansen.agency][mother]] and direct little [[https://tube.hansen.agency][films]] of joy.

I :heart: declarative, immutable infrastructure: ensuring predictable state and writing inheritable manifests makes teams go faster with fewer mistakes.
