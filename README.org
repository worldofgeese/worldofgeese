**** I'm [[https://t.me/taoscienceskyrocket][Tao]], your friendly Developer Advocate at @garden.io.

The Web is an Indra's Net of self-sovereign machines. My contributions to its pantheon are [[https://traefik.hansen.agency][mother]], a Synology DS-218+; Loving Kypris, a NUC10i7FNK running OpenShift; and Endless Summer, a fitlet-B running NixOS. In the past I directed little [[https://tube.hansen.agency][films]] of joy.

In another life I was Sovereign Bleak, a false prophet of a transhumanist movement making how-to guides for [[surgically implanting][https://vimeo.com/23836862]] finger-magnets.
